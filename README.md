# Translango frontend

The branch `frontend` tracks the progress of the frontend code for the app.
The initial code for this app was generated by `create-react-app` using this command: 

```bash
npx create-react-app translango --template=typescript
```

So, for running commands such as `npm start` first `cd` into the folder _tanslango_.
This app uses:
* Typescript
* Material UI wity styled components
* Material Icons
* Sass
